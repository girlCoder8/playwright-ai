# :performing_arts: Playwright Test Automation Project

This test automation project is designed to provide comprehensive end-to-end testing for The Free Online Bank Web site is published by Micro Focus Fortify[^1]. The project follows the Page Object Pattern structure to ensure maintainable and reusable test code.

## Features

* Page Object Pattern structure
* End-to-end (E2E) testing
* Advanced visual testing with snapshots
* API testing
* Automatic test execution through Jenkins

### Page Object Pattern Structure

The Page Object Pattern structure ensures that the tests are maintainable and reusable. This structure allows for easy updates and maintenance of the tests without having to update every test case individually.

### E2E Testing

The E2E tests cover all aspects of the application functionality and are designed to mimic real-world user scenarios. These tests cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the application works as intended for all users.

### Advanced Visual Testing

The project also includes advanced visual testing features, allowing you to test the appearance of the application and catch visual regressions early on. The visual testing is performed using snapshots, ensuring that the application looks and behaves as expected.

### API Testing

In addition to E2E and visual testing, the project also includes API tests. These tests ensure that the application's APIs are working as intended, providing a comprehensive testing solution.

### Automatic Test Execution through Jenkins

The test cases can be run automatically from Jenkins, providing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) capabilities. This means that you can run your tests automatically every time you make changes to the code, ensuring that the application always works as expected.

## Conclusion

This test automation project provides comprehensive testing, including E2E tests, advanced visual testing, and API tests. The Page Object Pattern structure ensures maintainable and reusable test code, while automatic test execution through Jenkins makes it easy to integrate testing into the development workflow.
